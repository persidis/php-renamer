# php-renamer
Searches a pdf for a specific keyword and renames the file with a word that follows.

Uses pdfparser (https://github.com/smalot/pdfparser) to parse the pdf file. Because pdfparser isn't always accurate you can tryout some of the options given as to which term to use after the search word.

Also creates a csv log file with the new filenames.
